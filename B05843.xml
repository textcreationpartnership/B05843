            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <byline>By <hi>R. SHERDLEY,</hi> who was formerly a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſter in the City of <hi>Kilkeny,</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>THE Actions and Deſigns of all Men have their Ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates: So has the Author in this ſmall Tract: It is not to be accounted Famous or Learned; neither does he hope to baniſh Schiſm, (that curſed Title which all Men hate, yet nouriſhd by many) out of a Kingdom where the Church of God is ſo eminently Glorified; but he is a Stranger here, and all Men that ſee him have their private Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of him; ſome by Information, believe him a Cheat, and an Impoſtor; others, one of the Regular Prieſts crept out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> purſuant to a late Act of Parliament made there; but tis commonly reported of him thus, eſpecially by ſuch who have ſome Knowledge of him: That he did really conform to the Eſtabliſhd Church at <hi>Kilkeny,</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by reaſon of his irregular and immoral Life: For had he not left the Presbyterian Party when he did, he woud have been Excluded their Societies in an open Synod or Convention of Presbyters. To this the Author Anſwers, That this Opinion is falſe and groundleſs; for he has it under the Hands of the Mayor, Aldermen, Sheriffs, and Proteſtant-Inhabitants of the City of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keny,</hi> affirming him to be a Man of a ſober Converſation; nay, he is not only thus fortified againſt malevolent Cenſure, but he has the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:176174:2"/>Hands of the very Presbyterians themſelves (who are ſtill Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in <hi>Kilkeny</hi>) declaring him to be a Man of an honeſt and regular Life: And further, the Provoſt and Senior Fellows of <hi>Trinity</hi>-Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, near <hi>Dublin,</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> have given him their own Hands to the like Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Now it may be objected, why the Author did not ſtay in a Kingdom where he was ſo well known for a Sober and Pious Man?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. Ireland</hi> was a Country very pernicious to the Author, as the Eminent Dr. <hi>Gwither</hi> of the College of <hi>Dublin</hi> can juſtine, he never enjoyd Six Weeks of Health ſucceſſively in Five Years Time: Moreover, <hi>England</hi> is the Land of his Nativity, and a Place where he enjoys a conſiderable Meaſure of Health, which Argument is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: But now tis reported, that he chiefly converſes with Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and ſince the Church of <hi>England</hi> takes not that Care of him he expected, he is endeavouring to ſement himſelf with thoſe of his former Factious Acquaintance. Now he does hereby endeavour to ſatisfie the World, that notwithſtanding all diſreſpect whatſoever ſhown him by the Eſtabliſh'd Church; yet, as he has never done any Thing to caſt him beyond the Pale of that Church, he is, and hopes always to remain a Member and Well-wiſher of the Churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as by Law Eſtabliſhd.</p>
            <p>Now to conclude he only mentions Two or Three of the Reaſons which induced him to Conformity.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Becauſe the lawful Commands, of a lawful Authority, are and ought to be obeyd in Things lawful.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Commands and Injunctions of the Eſtabliſhd Church are grounded upon a lawful Authority and enjoyns nothing ſinful, or in themſelves unlawful.</p>
            <p n="3">III. If ſo (granting Validity of the former Poſitions) to diſſent from this Authority, were to draw a Church out of a Church, which is poſitive Schiſm.</p>
            <p>Now the Author deſires the Reader to take Notice, that he does not pinch or ſqueeze too narrowly on the Term lawful, but freely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the full Sence the Term will bear.</p>
